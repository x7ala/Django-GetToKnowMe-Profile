                        <hr>
                        <p>When I first enrolled into this major in the fall of 2021, I had no expectations of what it would be like on top of going into it without prior knowledge or skill. It took a lot of confusion, hard work, and self improvement to feel involved and engaged. Brace yourself and don't give up!  </p>
                    
                        <p> Now, it's all about finding my desired focus in this field to continue working with in my future career throughout working on varying university required projects and some simple personal projects during my spare time. I'm open to exploring and learning new skills. </p>

                        <p> One more year left to graduate, let's see what it holds. </p>

					<p>Youtube channels & tutorials</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>
